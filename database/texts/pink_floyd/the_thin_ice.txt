The thin ice

Mamma loves her baby
And daddy loves you too.
And the sea may look warm to you, babe,
And the sky may look blue
But oooh babe,
Oooh baby blue.
Oooh babe.

If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes,
Don't be surprised when a crack
In the ice appears under your feet.
You slip out of your depth
And out of your mind
With your fear
Flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice.
