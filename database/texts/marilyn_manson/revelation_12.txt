Revelation #12

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Revelations come in 12.
I'll say it again.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Revelations come in 12.
I'll say it again.

And
You will burn in a town with no firemen
Just playing with matches and praying to ashes.
Too stupid to call themselves evil
Too stupid to call themselves evil
So they call themselves heroes

This is the time for US
This is the time for US

We’ll paint the town red
We’ll paint the town red
With the blood of the tourists
We’ll paint the town red
We’ll paint the town red
With the blood of the tourists

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Revelations come in 12.
I'll say it again.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Revelations come in 12.
I'll say it again.

Traitors and betrayers:
This fucking game has no fucking players
Traitors and betrayers:
This fucking game has no fucking players

So
"You got something to say now?"
"You got something to say now?"
This is the time for US
This is the time for US

We’ll paint the town red
We’ll paint the town red
With the blood of the tourists
We’ll paint the town red
We’ll paint the town red
With the blood of the tourists

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Revelations come in 12.
I'll say it again.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Revelations come in 12.
I'll say it again.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Revelations come in 12.
I'll say it again.
