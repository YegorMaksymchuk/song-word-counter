Deep six

You want to know what Zeus said to Narcissus?
"You'd better watch yourself"
You want to know what Zeus said to Narcissus?
"You'd better watch yourself"
"You'd better watch yourself"

YEAH

It's like a stranger
Had a key
Ð¡ame inside of my mind
And moved all my things around
He didn't know
Snakes can't eat a brain
Can't try to break the psyche down

YEAH

It's in my half-frozen wax
And your artillery lead
Do you like our plan?
Do you like our plan?

DEEP SIX, SIX, SIX FEET DEEP
DEEP SIX, SIX, SIX FEET DEEP

YEAH

LOVE IS EVOL
CON IS CONFIDENCE
EROS IS SORE
SIN IS SINCERE

DEEP SIX, SIX, SIX FEET DEEP
DEEP SIX, SIX, SIX FEET DEEP
