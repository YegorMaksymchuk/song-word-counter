All of my love

Should I fall out of love my fire in the night,
To chase a feather in the wind.
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight,
There moves a thread that has no end.

For many hours and days that pass ever soon,
The tides have caused the flame to dim.
At last the arm is straight the hand to the loom,
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To you now.
All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To you now.

The cup is raised the toast is made yet again.
One voice is clear above the din.
Proud Aryan one word my will to sustain,
For me the cloth once more to spin.

All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To you now.
All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To you now.

Yours is the cloth mine is the hand that sews time.
His is the force that lies within.
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find,
He is a feather in the wind.

All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To you now.
All of my love,
Oh, yes.
All of my love,
To you now.
All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love, love.
Sometime,
Sometime,
Sometime,
Sometime.
It's all, all, all, all,
All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To you now.
All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To, to you, and you, an you, and yeah.
I've got a little bit of love left.
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit of love left,
Just a little bit of love left.
