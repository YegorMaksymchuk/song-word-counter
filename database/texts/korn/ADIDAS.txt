A.D.I.D.A.S.

Honestly, somehow it always seems that
I'm dreaming of something I can never be
It doesn't bother me, 'cause I will always be
The pimp that I see in all of my fantasies
I don't know your fucking name, so what, let's...

Screaming to be the only way that
I can truly be free from my fucked up reality
So I dream and stroke it harder,
'Cause it's so fun to see my face staring back at me
I don't know your fucking name, so what, let's fuck

All day I dream about sex
All day I dream about fucking

All day I dream about sex, yes
All day I dream about sex, yes
All day I dream about sex, yes
All day I dream about sex, yes

All day I dream about fucking

All day I dream about sex, yes
All day I dream about sex, yes
All day I dream about sex, yes
All day I dream about sex, yes

All day I dream about sex
All day I dream about fucking
All day I dream about sex
All day I dream about fucking
