Black is the soul

As it all falls down, do I walk away
Or do l stand my ground and accept my fate?

And there is the faceless cries, that twist my every dream,
And almost every night I hear the demon sing.

Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again.
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray,
You're leading me to places I can never follow.

Happiness is found in darkest ways
And as I searched around,
I've made nothing but mistakes.

And there is the faceless cries, that twist my every dream,
And almost every night I hear the demon sing.

Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again.
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray,
You're leading me to places I can never follow.

And when you scream you push me so much further than,
And when I leave, I always would walk back again,
And when you cry the tears are cleansing bitterness,
I'm out of time, I'm slowly dying,
give me back my LIFE!
Just give me back my life.

Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play this game?
Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again.
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray,
You're leading me to places I can never follow.

As it all falls down, you will walk away
Or you will stand my ground?
There's nothing left to say.
