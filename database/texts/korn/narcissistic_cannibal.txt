korn

Narcissistic cannibal

Don't want to be sly and defile you
Desecrate my mind and rely on you
I just want to break this crown
But it's hard when I'm so rundown and

You're so cynical
Narcissistic cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead

Sometimes I hate
The life I made
Everything is wrong every time
Pushing on, I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Haunting me taking it's sweet time
Holding on, I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life 'til the end of my days

Don't want to be rude, but I have to
Nothing's good about the hell you put my through
I just need to look around
See the light that has come unbound

You're so cynical
Narcissistic cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead

Sometimes I hate
The life I made
Everything is wrong every time
Pushing on, I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Haunting me taking it's sweet time

Sometimes I hate
The life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on, I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Haunting me taking it's sweet time
Holding on, I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life 'til the end of my days
Holding on, I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life 'til the end of my days
