Power

I was fine before I met you
Truth is that I lost myself inside you
It is not fair to put all that on you
But you took control of a vulnerable soul

Yeah, I am my motherâ€™s daughter
And there are so many things I love about her
But I have, I have to break the cycle
So I can sit first at the dinner table

You can clip my wings,
can't wield my powers
Stole my time, but I make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done waiting, siphoning my powers
Power

I light no fury like a woman
Reborn, and now I'm burning like a blue flame
Once more, but don't mistake my warn for weakness
Don't bite the head down it, oh yeah
I'll never eat, no-oh

You can clip my wings,
can't wield my powers
Strong as time but I make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Summer's back and you better show it
I'm done waiting, siphoning my powers
Power

And now I'm taking it back
Electric as fuck (come on)
You can't quiet this thunder, no
Yeah, I'm taking it back
And all the way up
Even in the dark, I glow

You can clip my wings,
can't wield my flowers
Strong as time but I make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done waiting, siphoning my power
Power
