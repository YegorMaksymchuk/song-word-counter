S.E.X.

Oh my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my god, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed

When you read my mind,
Get down and discover me
I'm an open door, let you come inside of me
Want to put my hands around your neck
Gonna take you to a place that you will not forget

Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

Oh my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my god, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude, I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You gotta give me what I want, baby

Oh my god, let me clean your wound
I can be your nurse, got the antidote
Please show me where it hurts
Can you be my father? Tell me what to do
You can punish me and maybe I will punish you

Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

Oh my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my god, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude, I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You gotta give me what I want, baby

A lesson in sexology
Twisted rope, handcuffs,
Blindfolds, string of pearls
Neckties, silk scarfs,
Silver chains, pretty girls
Thigh highs, leather mask,
High heels, golden mask
Perfume, switch blade,
Absinthe, Novocaine
Chopsticks, underwear,
Barber soap, dental chair
Fish nets, satin sheets,
Garter belt, raw meat
Candle light, keyhole,
Leather belt, mink stole
Golden shower, latex thong,
Licorice whip, strap it on

Oh my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my god, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude, I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You gotta give me what I want, baby
