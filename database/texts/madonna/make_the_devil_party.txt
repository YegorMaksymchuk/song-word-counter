Devil pray

Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away

I've been swimming in the ocean
Till I'm almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

And we can do drugs
And we can smoke weed
And we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue
And we can do E
And we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah, we can run and we can hide
But we won't find the answers
If you got down then you'll get help along the way
But if you want to save your soul
Then we should travel all together
And make the Devil pray

O-o-ooh sing Hallelujah
Save my soul
O-o-ooh the Devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told

Mother Mary can't you help me?
Cause I've gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have flown away

The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on but I'm getting weaker
Watch me disappear

And we can do drugs
And we can smoke weed
And we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue
And we can do E
And we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah, we can run and we can hide
But we won't find the answers
If you got down then you'll get help along the way
But if you want to save your soul
Then we could travel all together
And make the Devil pray

O-o-ooh sing Hallelujah
Save my soul
O-o-ooh the Devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told

I said o-o-ooh sing Hallelujah
Save my soul
O-o-ooh The Devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told
